# 🚀 Backend Diagnostic Guide

## Current Status Analysis

Based on your logs, here's what's happening:

### ✅ What's Working:
- **Frontend** → **API** connection: ✅ Working
- **File Upload**: ✅ Working (batch created successfully)
- **Initial Status Check**: ✅ Working (returns PENDING)

### ❌ What's Not Working:
- **Celery Worker**: ❌ Not processing tasks
- **Task Processing**: ❌ "Task group not found for this batch"

## 🔍 Diagnostic Steps

### 1. Check Docker Services Status
```bash
# Check if all services are running
docker-compose ps

# You should see 3 services:
# - backend_api (port 8000)
# - backend_redis
# - backend_worker
```

### 2. Check Service Logs
```bash
# Check API logs
docker-compose logs api

# Check Worker logs (most important)
docker-compose logs worker

# Check Redis logs
docker-compose logs redis
```

### 3. Most Likely Issues:

#### Issue A: Worker Not Started
```bash
# Restart the worker service
docker-compose restart worker

# Or restart everything
docker-compose down
docker-compose up --build -d
```

#### Issue B: Redis Connection Problem
```bash
# Check Redis connectivity
docker-compose exec api redis-cli -h redis ping
# Should return: PONG
```

#### Issue C: Celery Worker Registration
```bash
# Check if worker is registered with Celery
docker-compose exec api celery -A app.tasks.celery_app inspect active
# Should return worker info
```

### 4. Recommended Fix:
```bash
# Complete restart with build
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up --build -d

# Wait 30 seconds for services to initialize
# Then check logs
docker-compose logs -f worker
```

## 🎯 Expected Working Flow:

1. **Upload CSV** → API creates batch → Returns batch_id ✅
2. **Celery Worker** → Picks up task → Starts processing ❌ (Not happening)
3. **Status Polling** → Shows progress → Eventually COMPLETED ❌

## 💡 Quick Test:

After restarting services, try uploading a small CSV file again. The worker logs should show:
```
[timestamp] Received task: process_csv_batch
[timestamp] Processing batch: your-batch-id
[timestamp] Created X child tasks for scraping
```

If you don't see these logs, the worker isn't processing tasks.

## 🚨 Common Solutions:

1. **Port conflicts**: Make sure ports 8000, 6379 (Redis) are available
2. **Docker resources**: Ensure Docker has enough memory allocated
3. **Environment variables**: Check .env file in backend directory
4. **File permissions**: Ensure Docker can read/write in project directory
